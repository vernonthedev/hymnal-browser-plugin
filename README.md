### Professional Hymn Broadcast Console & Overlay Server

## Key Features

*   **Lightning Fast Search:** Find any hymn in seconds by number or title using the numeric search rail.
*   **Live Control Room:** Preview current, previous, and next lines before they go live on screen.
*   **Real-time Styling:** Adjust font size, alignment, animations, and speaker labels on the fly without refreshing overlays.
*   **Multi-Output Support:** Dedicated overlay profiles for Lower Thirds, Stage Displays, and Full-screen Lyrics.
*   **Power-User Shortcuts:** Full keyboard control (Space, Enter, Arrows) for seamless operation during service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This application requires ports 9999 (HTTP) and 8765 (WebSocket) to be available. The internal server starts automatically upon launch. Ensure you click the **URLs** button in the app header to retrieve the active links for your broadcast software.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (preferred) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/) (required only for building app icons)

### Installation & Development

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Broadcast Integration

1.  Launch SDA Hymnal Desktop.
2.  Click the **URLs** button in the top right.
3.  Copy the URL for your desired overlay (e.g., Lower Third).
4.  In OBS or vMix, add a new **Browser Source**.
5.  Paste the URL and set the size to **1920x1080**.

## Development & Packaging

### Building Icons
Packaging commands require generated icons. Run this once before your first distribution build:
```bash
bun run build:icons
```

### Creating Installers
Generate production-ready installers for your platform:
```bash
bun run dist:win    # Windows (.exe, .nsis)
bun run dist:mac    # macOS (.dmg)
bun run dist:linux  # Linux (.AppImage, .deb)
```

## Automated Releases

Pushes to the main branch trigger an automated CI workflow that:
- Runs semantic-release for versioning.
- Updates CHANGELOG.md.
- Generates platform-specific installers.
- Uploads installers directly to a new GitHub Release.
